- Why javascript Function are first class citizen
- Becoz we can pass the function to the variable, save to data structure
- And Many more
- Higher Order function - take function as argument or return the functions
```
- we can store the Functions in the variables
- We can pass the Function as a argument
```
- Arrow Functions
- Using the anfn we can access it
```
let consider i have let value = 20;

let value = 20;

outer function
    value = 100; 
    inner funct()
outside the function 
value = 20; - For the each step it will be changing becoz it is refering the value not the specific varible
