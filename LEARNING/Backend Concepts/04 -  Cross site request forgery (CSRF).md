### 🔁 Real-World CSRF Flow (in your words):

1. **You're logged into your bank** → your session cookie is stored in your browser.
    
2. **You visit a funny/malicious page** controlled by an attacker.
    
3. **You click a link or the page auto-submits a hidden form.**
    
4. **Your browser sends a request to the bank** (e.g., to transfer money) **with your session cookie**.
    
5. **The bank thinks it's you**, so it processes the action.
    
6. ✅ **Attacker gains money** — **without you even knowing**.


## 🚨 Short Answer:

> ❌ **No, the CSRF token is not sent to the hacker**.  
> ✅ The **browser sends the token only to your own server**, and the **hacker cannot access or see it.**

## 🔐 Here's the Core Truth:

|Thing|Where it’s stored|Who can access it|Can hacker get it?|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Session ID (cookie)**|In your browser cookie|Automatically sent to your **server**|❌ Hacker can't read it, but it’s **auto-sent** in requests|
|**CSRF Token**|In your **server session** + injected to frontend|Frontend gets it via **form field** or **JS API**|❌ Hacker can’t access it — **not sent to attacker site**|

### 🧪 Example:

#### ✅ You (the user):

- Log in → server sends session cookie (`sessionid=abc123`)
    
- Server also gives you a CSRF token (e.g., `token=xyz456`) as:
    
    - A hidden form field OR
        
    - An HTTP response (via AJAX/API)
        

#### ❌ Hacker:

- **Can make your browser send a request to the bank**
    
- But **cannot read**:
    
    - Your **session cookie**
        
    - Your **CSRF token**
        
- So they **can't include the correct token**, and server rejects it 💥

### 🧠 In simple one-liner:

> **Even though the CSRF token is linked to your session, it's never sent to the hacker, because only your browser and server can see or use it.**
