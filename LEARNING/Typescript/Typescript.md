Why typescript ?
```
- is updated version of js
- We cannot define the static types [like string, int]
```
- How to install it?
```
npm install -g typescript 
```
- how to run it
```
tcs index.ts

//auto reload
tcs --watch index.ts
```
- how to download ES6 module
```

tsc init

in the tsconfig.json -- we need to update the target according to the need

- outdir -- compiled output need to be one folder so we need to put
- outdir: "./dist"


- This is the root folder that folders are there
- "rootDir": "./src",

```
