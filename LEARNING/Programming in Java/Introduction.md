What is java
- Java files are stored in files suffixed with `.java` . These files are then compiled into **Java byte code** using the Java compiler, and the byte code is then executed using the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The Java compiler and the JVM are part of the Java Development Kit.
- Byte code -> .class
- The Java Virtual Machine is implemented for several different operating systems, like Windows, Mac OS, Linux, IBM mainframes
- Sun referred to this as "Write once, run anywhere".
JRE
- The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is the Java Virtual Machine and the standard Java APIs coming with Java Standard Edition (JSE). The JRE contains enough to execute a Java application, but not to compile it.
SDK
- The Java Software Development Kit (Java SDK) is the JRE plus the Java compiler, and a set of other tools.
Package
- If you locate a Java class inside a Java package, you have to specify the package name at the top of the Java file. Here is how the class from earlier looks with a package declaration added
